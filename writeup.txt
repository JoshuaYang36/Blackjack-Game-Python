In this folder there are two programs: queries.txt and summary.py

In queries.txt I answered the questions and printed out the output.

In summary.py I have a few functions: main, bill, capcase, upper and shorten

My main function pulls in all the arguments from the command line and called them 
accordingly. Then it sends them to the function bill.

My bill function will take the name, year and month that you want the bill to be about. I
first go through the list of movie rentals that I collected and only put the ones that 
were rented during that month and year in a list. I then went through that list and 
formatted them and made sure that there was no late fee.  If the difference was greater 
than the rental_duration then it would print out the title, rental_date and rental_rate
then in the line below it it would print late fee, the return_date and the additional 
rental_rate. If the difference wasn't greater than the rental_duration then it would just 
print out the title, rental_date and the rental_rate.  Then I calculated the total cost of 
the rented movies during that month.

The capcase function just capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string that is
inputted into the function.

The upper function just puts the string into all upper cases.

The shorten function takes in the date that is given and then switches into the typical 
month/day/year format.
