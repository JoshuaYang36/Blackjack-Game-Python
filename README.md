# Blackjack-Game-Python

A Blackjack game I made back in my sophmore year of college. I used Python 3 and Tkinter to build 
the backend and frontend respectively.

I used this project to learn about object-oriented programming, creating 'card objects' with color, 
value, and number attributes.

One of my favorite projects, because it was so challenging grasping the concept at first. BUT, it all 
paid off in the end!!
